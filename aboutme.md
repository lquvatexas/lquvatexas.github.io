My name is Lin Qiu, a 4th year Biostatistics Ph.D. student at Penn State University, advised by [Dr. Vernon M. Chinchilli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernon_Chinchilli) and [Dr. Lin Lin](http://www.personal.psu.edu/lul37/).

I interned with Snap Research working with [Dr. Vitor Silva Sousa](https://research.snap.com/team/vitor-silva-sousa) and [Dr. Nils Murrugarra-Llerena](https://research.snap.com/team/nils-murrugarra-llerenaon) on Snapchat user engagement understanding during fall 2020.

It is believed that the gods created the world full of magic and inexhaustible energy. To human beings, powers from
three energy sources are the strongest - solar energy, love and imagination. Therefore I would like to choose
a career I will love, and let my imagination release imprisoned possibilities.
