I'm a marathon runner and music lover. 

It is believed that the gods created the world full of magic and inexhaustible energy. To human beings, powers from
three energy sources are the strongest - solar energy, love, and imagination. Therefore I would like to chase
a career I will love, and let my imagination release imprisoned possibilities.
